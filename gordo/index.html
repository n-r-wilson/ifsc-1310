        <p><q>Like a monkey, ready to be shot into space. Space monkey! Ready to sacrifice himself for the greater good. Without pain, without sacrifice, we would have nothing!</q><br />
         - Tyler Durden, NASA Commissioner</p>
        
        <h2>Old Reliable</h2>
          
          <p>Gordo was one of the first monkeys to make it into space as part of NASA's space program. Eight monkeys had flown on NASA missions before him, five of whom went by the name of Albert.<br />
          Below is a list of Gordo's predecessors in the prestigious NASA space monkey line and their achievements:</p>
          
          <ol>
            <li>Albert
              <ul>
                <li>died of suffocation</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Albert II

                <li>first primate in space</li>
                <li>died on impact</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Albert III, the crab eating macaque
              <ul>
                <li>died at 35,000 feet in an explosion</li>
                <li>it was a very cool explosion</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Albert IV
              <ul>
                <li>flew on the last V-2 flight</li>
                <li>reached 130.6 kilometers</li>
                <li>almost survived, but didn't</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>a monkey possibly called Albert V
              <ul>
                <li>first flight on an Aerobee rocket</li>
                <li>died due to parachute failure</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Yorick, also called Albert VI, accompanied by 11 mouse crewmates</li>
            <li>Particia</li>
            <li>Mike</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>Gordo's historic flight took place on December 13, 1958 when he took off from Cape Canaveral for a 15 minute flight into space. Even though he was weightless for over 8 minutes the on-board instruments indicated that Gordo enjoyed his journey into space. Scientists monitoring the flight were pleased to note that the only slight side effect Gordo suffered from the entry into space was a modest slowing of his pulse.</p>
        
        
        <h2>The Mission</h2>
          
          <p>The rocket carrying Gordo into space would take off from the Atlantic Missile Range at Cape Canaveral, travel further than any monkey had ever travelled before - over 1,500 miles - and reach a height of 310 miles (500 km) before returning to Earth and landing in the South Atlantic, 1,302 nautical miles south of Cape Canaveral.</p>
          
          <blockquote>"We all heard the rumors that they want to send a monkey up first. Well, none of us wants to think that they're gonna send a monkey up to do a man's work ... what they're trying to do to us is <stong>send a man up to do a monkey's work.</stong>"</blockquote>

        <h3>The Jupiter AM-13</h3>
          
          <p>The Jupiter IRBM (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile) was originally developed by the US Army as a long-range successor to its PGM-11 Redstone missile, but was eventually taken over and deployed by the USAF for political reasons. It was also the only one of the United States' early stategic ballistic missiles with some mobility.</p>
          
          <p>Flight Date: December 13, 1958<br />
          Launch Time: 03.53 EST</p>
          
          <p>Below is a comparison of the Early V-2 rockets used in Albert I through IV's flights and the Aerobee rockets used in later missions:</p>

        <h2>The Journey</h2>
          
          <p>Gordo wore a specially customised space suit custom made for a monkey about one foot tall. The space suit was fitted with instruments, including temperature meters and microphones which recorded his historic suborbital journey, considered one of the outstanding achievements of space research.</p>
          
          <p>Flight Time: 15 Minutes<br />
          Apogee: 310 Miles</p>
          
          <h3>The Fate of Gordo "Sky King" the Space Monkey</h3>
          
            <p>Gordo is perhaps most famous for the candid exchange he had with mission control once he found out that the parachute had failed to deploy.<br />
            Gordo: <q>Hey, do you think if I land this successfully, Alaska will give me a job as a pilot?</q><br />
            Mission Control: <q>You know, I think they would give you a job doing anything if you could pull this off.</q><br />
            Gordo: <q>Yeah right! ... Nah, I'm just a South American squirrel monkey.</q><br /></p>
            
            <p>In total the flight lasted 15 minutes, of which Gordo was weightless for 8.3 minutes, as the craft exited and re-entered Earth's atmosphere at a speed of over 10,000 miles per hour. The failure of Gordo's parachute meant that both he and the capsule were lost, despite efforts to recover them.<br />
            <em>It is believed that Gordo was alive at the time of impact.</em></p>
            
            <blockquote>"I wouldn't know how to land it. I wasn't really planning on landing it."</blockquote>
            <p> - the final words of Captain Gordo</p>
            
            <h4>Gordo's Legacy</h4>
            <p>Gordo was survived by a monkey wife and 3 monkey children. Greiving for her lost husband, Mrs. Gordetta sued NASA for criminal negligence in their parachute design. The jury, made up entirely of human people, ruled in favor of NASA.</p>
            <p>Gordo's first son, Gordo Jr. took up a job at the circus in order to help pay the bills for court costs. He died only a year later, on the aniversary of his father's death, in a tragic accident in which the doors on his tiny clown car would not open. He suffocated inside that car with 13 others before the rescue services were able to get the car open.</p>
            <p>The life of Gordo was later recounted in a biography written by Simon McMonke which topped the New York Times best-sellers list for monkey biographies.</p>
