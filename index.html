  <h2>Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>Progressive Enhancement is a method of web design which focuses on building out from the content, making an experience that works across older and modern web browsers.
   The process begins with making sure that the HTML alone provides a usable experience for those wishing to access the siteâ€™s content from a more limited browser.
   The next step is writing CSS around that HTML in such a way that the addition of CSS is not harming the HTML-only experience. Finally, the site or page is given a layer of unobtrusive JavaScript to enhance the experience for browsers that support it (again, without harming the HTML-only or HTML + CSS experiences).
   I think this approach to web design makes sense, and I can see where it would have utility even without considering the need for backwards compatibility with more limited browsers. The approach of building the site from the content outwards means the designer is more likely to follow good practice in marking up their HTML and write CSS that can be more easily reused on other pages and sites.
   The idea of unobtrusive JS also seems like a good rule of thumb for creating an easily navigable user interface for a site. I do also see where this approach can be limiting though. If a web designer wants to flex their abilities to create a site with very advanced CSS and JS, where the code is really the content itself, using a method of Progressive Enhancement may not necessarily be the best or most practical approach.
   I also read <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Graceful_degradation_versus_progressive_enhancement">this article</a>, which gives an interesting example of using progressive enhancement to implement a print page function: <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Graceful_degradation_versus_progressive_enhancement">https://www.w3.org/wiki/Graceful_degradation_versus_progressive_enhancement</a></p>
